I built a visually appealing personal portfolio using Django, HTML, and CSS. I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for building robust web applications, and I created a responsive and user-friendly website that showcases my skills and expertise. My portfolio stands out with clean and organized code and attention to detail.
